I’m Fadhil, a systems and high-performance computing (HPC)
engineer with a deep passion for Linux, low-level programming, and scalable system design. 
My work and interests revolve around building, understanding, and optimizing something
from the Linux kernel and networking stack to performance-driven architectures.


Over the years, I’ve worked with technologies ranging from C/C++ and Rust to 
distributed systems, containers, and virtualization. Beyond coding, I enjoy 
exploring how operating systems, filesystems, and compilers work under the hood
and applying that knowledge to solve real engineering problems.
